                    <span>Pineapple bun</span> Despite its name, this bun contains no pineapple. Its sugary, golden crust resembles a pineapple's texture. Originating in post-war Hong Kong, it reflects Western baking influences on Chinese pastries. Often eaten warm with a slice of butter.

                    <span>Hong Kong milk tea</span> is nicknamed "silk stocking tea" due to the cloth filter used in brewing. This strong black tea mixed with evaporated milk is a legacy of British colonial influence. It's a creamy, slightly bitter drink found in nearly every Hong Kong diner.
